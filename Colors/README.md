# Momentum Design System UI Kits

[Momentum Design System](https://momentum.design) provides UI libraries to assist in creating Cisco Webex designs. The libraries are here to optimize our designers’ workflow as they provide the most commonly used components across Webex products. We have five libraries: one for each platform that our products are built for. Each library is constantly evolving as the functionality and needs of our applications change. The following guide will help set up the libraries to automatically update in Sketch whenever we push any updates.

## Requirements

### Sketch

Download the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).
<br />

## Getting Started

The Momentum Design team has made optimizations with this Sketch Library so you can more efficiently create Cisco Webex interfaces. In the instructions below, we’ll cover the basics and some tips for you to get started.

Sketch Libraries allow you to have Momentum Design components and patterns available from Sketch’s symbols menu in any file you open. Sketch Libraries will automatically update your designs when the library is updated. Your designs will never be out of date if they’re linked to this Sketch Library document.

Throughout a release, Momentum's design team contributes to these Sketch files through an application called <a href="https://www.abstract.com/" target="_blank" title="Abstract">Abstract</a>. Public contributions become unmanageable to merge since they are added to a version that is out of date.
